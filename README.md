# Bozo
A short, narrative-driven CLI adventure game about dealing with your inner critic, written in C++.

## How to Compile and Run
This project consists of three main source files: `game.cpp`, `room.cpp`, and `room.h`.

### Compilation
To compile the game on a Linux system (like KDE Neon), use the g++ compiler:
```bash
g++ game.cpp room.cpp -o bozo
```

### Running
Once compiled, you can run the game directly from your terminal:
```bash
./bozo
```
